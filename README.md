# SmuggleSheild
***Beta Version***

I have tried to create an extension which prevents basic HTML smuggling attacks based on patterns. This is not a bulletproof soultion but an attempt, also still in testing phase! 

The extension is compatible both on Chrome & Edge for Mac and Windows OS. Enable developer mode under extension setting and click on "Load unpacked" the "SumggleSheild" folder the extension would be up and running.
